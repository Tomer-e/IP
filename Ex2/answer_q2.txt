actually nothing severe(as long as all the gaussian exist in our new image, i.e we can get the image
 in which the center of the gaussian is at (0,0) by shifting), since fourier transform is not local
(the transform supplies a global representation of the image in the frequency domain).so the difference will be only in the image phases, and if we have two images with different phases (i.e the (0,0) in different locaations) we can only expect to problems with the result image.
