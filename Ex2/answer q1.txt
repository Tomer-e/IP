when we derives in the Fourier space ,multiplying by "u" gives more weight to the higher
frequencies than lower frequencies ==> image derivative in the fourier space will cause the edges to
be brighter then image derivatives in image space(we convolve with [1 0 -1] - all the frequencies
get the same weight)
