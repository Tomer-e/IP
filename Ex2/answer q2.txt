actually nothing(as long as all the gaussian exist in our new image, i.e we can get the image
 in which the center of the gaussian is at (0,0) by shifting), since fourier transform is not local
(the transform supplies a global representation of the image in the frequency domain). In the two images
we have the same frequencies.
